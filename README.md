# Interactive Bézier Rope - React + Tailwind

A **React** project that simulates an interactive **cubic Bézier curve** behaving like a springy rope.  
Drag the control points to see the rope bend naturally, with **physics-based motion** and **tangent visualization**.

---

## 🎯 Features

- **Cubic Bézier Curve** with 4 control points (P0, P1, P2, P3)  
- **Dynamic control points (P1 & P2)** with spring-damping physics  
- **Tangent visualization** along the curve  
- **Interactive dragging** of points with smooth motion  
- Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **HTML Canvas**  
- Fully manual Bézier math and physics (no external libraries)
